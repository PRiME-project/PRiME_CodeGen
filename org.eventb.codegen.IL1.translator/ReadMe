org.eventb.codegen.il1.translator.core

Provided here are abstract classes that we believe to be the basic required translations for each type, which might be useful for new translators. 
You can use these then do any required transformations of the translations to the target language.

If they don't do the job required for a particular language, extend the AbstractIL1Translator element directly.

# PRiME Code Generation Plugin

PRiME code generation plugin is a [Rodin](https://sourceforge.net/projects/rodin-b-sharp/files/Core_Rodin_Platform/) framework plugin that translates [Event-B](http://www.event-b.org) formal models to executable C/C++ code. The plugin is based on [Tasking Event-B](http://wiki.event-b.org/index.php/Tasking_Event-B_Overview) code generation plugin and has been extended to generate platform-dependent code from platform-independent formal models.
